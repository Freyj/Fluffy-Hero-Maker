# Fluffy Hero Maker
## What is this?
This is an attempt at having a semi-automatic way of building characters or accessing some of my data for my tabletop rpg games.

## What games does it cover?
For now, only Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (SRD), but I plan to cover other systems too, later on.

## How do I add data?
It uses json files to fill its databases, and the only files on this are from data that is part of the SRD  (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd)
To add data, you can find templates of the json structures in the **utils** directory.

## How do I run it?
Ideally, just launching ```python3 cli_main.py``` should do the trick.
This is only in command-line interface for now, graphics are a pest.

## What can I do with it?
You can create a character, picking a name, race, and class. 
You can display monster stats or spell stats also.

## What is lacking?
A lot.
* All the SRD data taken into account.
* Cleaner code.
* Cleaner everything.
* Not CLI display
* Especially more than just one class to pick from

## Why this name?
Because this world needs more fluffy things. Also it is a partially wrong name, as it is more of a fluffy-helper than a fluffy-hero-maker, but eh.

## Danger zone
* HJigh risk of things changing a lot because this is very flimsy.
* Also, high probability of bugs

## Licensing
Not exactly sure yet how I license this, so for now, it's ALL MINE and you're allowed to look at it and be amazed (or shocked).

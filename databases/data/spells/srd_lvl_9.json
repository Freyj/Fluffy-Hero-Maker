    "description": "\tYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane).\n\tThe material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.\n\tYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions.\n\tThe principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot.\n\tThis cord is your tether to your material body.\n\tAs long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home.\n\tIf the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\n\tYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane.\n\tIf you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.\n\tYour astral form is a separate incarnation.\n\tAny damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.\n\tThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\n\tThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions.\n\tA successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature.\n\tIf a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature.\n\tIf the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\n\tIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.",
